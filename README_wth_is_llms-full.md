# What the heck is "llms-full.txt" ?

The "llms-full.txt" file format builds upon the "llms.txt" specifications by incorporating the full, detailed content of referenced pages into a single, consolidated Markdown file, rather than limiting it to curated links and summaries [What is LLMs.txt LLMs-Full.txt?](https://journal.withdaydream.com/p/what-is-llms-txt-llms-full-txt). This extension allows for direct access to comprehensive information, streamlining ingestion by large language models (LLMs) without requiring additional navigation [The value of llms.txt: Hype or real?](https://mintlify.com/blog/the-value-of-llms-txt-hype-or-real).

In contrast to "llms.txt", which serves as an index with brief descriptions and links organized under sections like headings and optional details, "llms-full.txt" includes the actual text content of those linked pages [llms.txt](https://llmstxt.org/). For instance, while "llms.txt" might list URLs with short summaries, "llms-full.txt" compiles all associated documentation into one file, preserving the original structure and hierarchy in Markdown format [llms.txt](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/llms-txt-overview/). This makes it particularly useful for scenarios where LLMs need immediate, unfragmented access to detailed resources, such as API documentation or onboarding guides [What is LLMs.txt LLMs-Full.txt?](https://journal.withdaydream.com/p/what-is-llms-txt-llms-full-txt).
